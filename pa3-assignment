Spring 2015
Programming Assignment 3
Assigned: 31 March, 2015
Deadline: 7 April, 2015

This assignment is due on April 7, before class begins.

You will submit it via github as usual. Since this is the third github
assignment and you're all comfortable with the tool, we won't accept
ANY late submissions. If you anticipate any questions or issues with
github itself, let me or Muktadir know right before the due date.

Note that user-defined functions in mySQL can be tricky to get working
(just like setting up the program for the first assignment!). Even for
simple ones like the first two below, it will take you a little trial
and error to get it working, so allow time for experimentation.

# PART ONE: 10 points

Create a simple mySQL user-defined function using only the SQL command line interface.

Function name: exp
Parameters: two integers
Returns: an int, the result of multiplying the two parameters together


Because you're doing this one on the command line, all you'll need to
submit is a plaintext file showing (1) the sql commands you executed
to create the function, (2) the sql command to invoke the function,
and (3) the result you saw.

For example, if you were to submit a function like the "hello world" we did in class, you would submit a text file with the following lines:

mysql> create function hw( ) returns varchar(20)  
mysql> return( 'hello world!' );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> select hw();
+--------------+
| hw()         |
+--------------+
| hello world! |
+--------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

# PART TWO: 15 points

Write a SQL function (a stored function this time, saved in a .sql
file) that calcualtes the area of a circle, given its radius.

Your function should declare a variable to save the area in before it
does the actual computation.

Function input: double, the radius
Return value: double, the circle's area


Submission:

* Submit to github your .sql file containing your function

* In your README file, include at least 4 inputs you've tested in calling your function, and the results you saw.

# PART THREE: 75 points

##########################################################

For the rest of this assignment, you'll write functions to read and
maniuplate data from the mySQL employees database (remember it? You
can get it here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/ )

* Write a function that returns the first and last name of all
  employees that match a given argument. For example, if I invoke the
  function with the argument "Bouloucos", it should return Chenye
  Bouloucos, Kristinn Bouloucos, Otmar Bouloucos, etc. (there are
  nearly 200 of them).

* Write a function that returns the average salary of all employees
  who work in a given department (with department specified by its ID
  number, in the argument to the function).

* Write a function that takes one argument ('M' or 'F') and returns
  how many employees exist of the given gender.
